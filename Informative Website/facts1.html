        Researchers have started to test whether a home remedy for the common
        cold might help with early symptoms of COVID-19. Rinsing the nostrils
        and gargling with salt water has been used by some as a way of treating
        cold symptoms for many years. A small pilot study in just over 60 adults
        with colds found that most people who used salt water rinsing thought it
        made a difference to their symptoms. They also found that their cold
        lasted a day or two less than people who did not use salt water rinsing.
        Some of the people in this study had colds caused by earlier human
        coronaviruses. While this study does suggest some benefit of saline
        rinsing for people with colds, we can’t be sure that some of this wasn’t
        down to people rating their symptoms as improved because they expected
        the salt water rinse to be helpful. The same researchers are repeating
        their study in people with early symptoms of COVID-19. COVID-19 is
        caused by a new and more serious type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) than
        those that cause the common cold, so we don’t yet know whether salt
        rinsing will help.<br />

      <h1>Where did the story come from?</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        News outlets including the Evening Standard in the UK carried stories
        about the new salt water study. The Standard’s headline implies that
        research already backs up the theory, when in fact the study has only
        just started. We won’t know if salt water rinsing has any effect until
        it has been completed.
      </p>

      <h1>What is the basis for the claim?</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Researchers from the University of Edinburgh carried out the trial of
        salt water rinsing and the common cold and are starting a similar trial
        in people with COVID-19. Their study was a small pilot study with
        results from 61 adults with a cold but who were otherwise healthy. The
        participants had developed symptoms in the last 48 hours and were
        randomly allocated to either gargle and clear their noses with a salt
        water solution, or to just carry on doing whatever they would normally
        do to treat a cold. They found that participants who used the salt water
        solution reported fewer coughs, less congestion, and one to two days’
        shorter duration of cold symptoms than those who didn’t. Some of this
        impact may have been down to people expecting to feel better after
        receiving the treatment being studied (the salt solution) than when they
        have no treatment. The new coronavirus pandemic prompted the researchers
        to look back at their results, as some common colds are caused by older
        types of coronavirus. When just looking at the 15 people whose colds
        were caused by coronaviruses, they also showed a trend for reduction in
        symptoms with the salt water gargling and rinsing. This led the
        researchers to think that it was worth repeating the study in people
        with COVID-19.The researchers are inviting people over 18 in Scotland
        with symptoms of COVID-19 that started in the previous 48 hours to take
        part in the new study.

      <h1>What do trusted sources say?</h1>
      <p>
        Gargling and nose-washing are not currently recommended to improve the
        symptoms of COVID-19 or to prevent infection. The Harvard TH Chan School
        of Public Health India Research Centre says: “There is no evidence that
        regularly gargling [saltwater or saline] has protected people from
        infection with the new coronavirus. While this may help soothe a sore
        throat, this practice will not prevent the virus from entering your
        lungs.”
