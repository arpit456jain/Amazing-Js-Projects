        <h1>How can I protect myself ?</h1>
        <p>Visit <a class="l" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APwq1df6Mw">How to Protect Yourself & Others to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19.</a></p>
        
        <h1>Is it recommended to use facemask or face coverings to prevent COVID-19 ?</h1>
        <p>Wear cloth face coverings in public settings when around people not living in your household and particularly where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and gas stations. Cloth face coverings may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.
           COVID-19 can be spread by people who do not have symptoms and do not know that they are infected. 
           That’s why it’s important for everyone to practice social distancing (staying at least 6 feet away from other people) and w
           ear cloth face coverings in public settings.</P> 
           <p>Cloth face coverings provide an extra layer to help prevent the respiratory droplets from traveling in the air and onto other people.
            The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators.  
            Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other 
            medical first responders.</p>
          
          
        <h1> Is it safe to care about my other medical conditions during this time ?</h1>
      
       <p> 1.It is important to continue taking care of your health and wellness.</p>
       <p>  2.Continue your medications, and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider.</p>
       <p> 3.Continue to manage your disease the way your healthcare provider has told you.</p>        
       <p> 4.Have at least a 2-week supply of all prescription and non-prescription medications.   </p>     
       <p> 5.Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations are up-to-date.   </p>     
      
      <h1>Am I risk for COVID-19 from mail,packages and products?</h1>
      <p>There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
         Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
          Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, 
          products or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has 
         the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,
         but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
      
      <h1>Should I use soap and water or Hand sanitizers to protect against COVID-19?</h1>
      <p>Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
         Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; 
         going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand 
         sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.</p>
      
      <h1>What cleansing product should I use to protect from COVID-19?</h1>
      <p>Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, 
        phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.  If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
         To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.</p>
