      <h1>
        Am I protected against COVID-19 if I had the influenza vaccine this
        year?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Influenza and the virus that causes COVID-19 are two very different
        viruses and the seasonal influenza vaccine will not protect againt
        COVID-19.
      </p>
      <h1>Will a pneumococcal vaccine help protect me against coronavirus?</h1>
      <p>
        Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus
        influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, only help protect people from these
        specific bacterial infections. They do not protect against any
        coronavirus pneumonia, including pneumonia that may be part of COVID-19.
        However even though these vaccines do not specifically protect against
        the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, they are highly recommended to
        protect against pther respiratory illnesses.
      </p>
      <h1>Are antibiotics effective in treating or preventing COVID-19?</h1>
      <p>
        No, Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial
        infections. Antibiotics do not prevent or treat coronavirus
        disease(COVID-19), because COVID-19 os caused by a virus, not bacteria.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Can antivirals such as Oseltamavir or other antivirals help treat
        COVID-19?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Currently, there is no specific treatment for this disease, so
        healthcare providers treat the clinical symptoms with supportive care
        which has been highly effective for patients with symptoms. Various drug
        trials are underway (eg: chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir).
      </p>
      <h1>
        Are there any natural health products that can treat or prevent
        COVID-19?
      </h1>
      <p>
        At this time, there are no natural health products that are authorized
        to treat or protect against COVID-19.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their
        own. your health care provider may recommend steps you can take to
        relieve symptoms.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Is Hydoxy-chloroquinine approved for use in close contacts of confirmed
        cases of COVID-19?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Indian Council of medical Research(ICRM) recommends the use of
        hydroxy-chloquine for chemoprophylaxis of COVID-19 infection in high
        risk population.
