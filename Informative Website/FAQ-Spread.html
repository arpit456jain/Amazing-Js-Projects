    <h1>Can someone spread the virus without being sick?</h1>
    <p>People are thought to be most contagious when they are more symptomatic(the sickest). Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms, but this is not thought to be the way the virus spreads.</p>
    <h1>How long does the virus survive on surfaces?</h1>
    <p>It is not certain how long the virus that causes Covid-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses.Studies suggest that coronaviruses(including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions. </p>
    <p>A new analysis found that the virus can remain viable in the air for upto 3 hours, on copper for upto 4 hours, on cardboard upto 24 hours and on plastic and stainless steel upto 2 to 3 days.</p>
    <h1>If a colleague gets infected, what should be done?</h1>
    <p>Suggest your colleague to observe self-isolation & seek urgent medical help.</p>
    <p>If you were in close contact with you colleague, observe home quarantine and monitor yourself for symptoms. If you develop symptoms, seek medical help.</p>
    <h1>Can Covid-19 be transmitted by blood transfusion?</h1>
    <p>In general, respiratory viruses are not known to be transmitted by blood transfusion, and there have not been any reported cases of transfusion-transmitted coronavirus.</p>
    <p>Routine blood donor screening measures that are already in place should prevent individuals with clinical respiratoryinfections from donating blood. For example, blood donors must be in good health and have a normal temperature on the day of donation.</p>
    <h1>Is it true that hot & humid climates will stop new coronavirus transmission?</h1>
    <p>No. From the evidence so far, the virus <strong>can be</strong> transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates.</p>
    <h1>We have servants coing to our house, are we at greater risk of getting corona infection?</h1>
    <p>Risk of getting infected with Covid-19 is by person-to-person contact. The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.</p>
