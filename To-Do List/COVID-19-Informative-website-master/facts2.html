      <p>
        Trials are underway to see whether blood products from people who have
        recovered from COVID-19 can help boost the immune response of people
        with severe infection.
      </p>
      <p>
        People who have recovered from COVID-19 will have produced specific
        antibodies that target the virus and mark it out for destruction by
        other immune cells. These antibodies remain in the clear blood fluid
        (plasma) after they recover. Doctors are carrying out trials to find out
        whether giving an infusion of this ‘convalescent plasma’ from a donor
        could help people who are seriously ill. Convalescent plasma has been
        used to treat other respiratory viruses, including SARS, in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        To date, only a few observational reports are available on its use in
        COVID-19, which cannot provide good evidence. However, 22 randomised
        controlled trials are now underway, which should give more reliable
        results on whether this investigational product is a safe and effective
        treatment for COVID-19.
      </p>
      <h1>Where did the story come from?</h1>
      <p>
        Several media outlets (NBC and Mail Online) have reported on the use of
        convalescent plasma in hospitals. Healthcare services in the UK and US
        among other countries are asking people who have recovered from COVID-19
        to register to donate their plasma. However, a Cochrane systematic
        review of studies completed so far said there was not yet enough
        evidence to say whether it works. Convalescent plasma is regulated as an
        investigational product, for use in trials currently.
      </p>
      <h1>What is the basis for the claim?</h1>
      <p>
        In late April, the Cochrane review searched for studies that reported
        using convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19. They identified eight
        observational studies, including 32 patients, most of whom needed
        respiratory support. Patients were followed up from between 3 and 37
        days after transfusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of the patients died during follow-up. Six studies reported seeing
        improvement in patient symptoms after transfusion. However, the quality
        of reporting was poor, and the researchers could not extract sufficient
        information about these improvements. Neither were the studies
        consistent in their reporting of admissions to intensive care, duration
        of stay, or discharges from hospital.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore this provides very limited evidence on the effect of
        convalescent plasma. Because there was no comparison group of patients
        receiving standard or alternative care, we do not know whether any
        improvements were a direct result of the infusion. They might have been
        due to other treatment, or just reflected the natural course of the
        infection.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, two patients in two studies experienced adverse reactions. One
        got a fever after having the infusion of convalescent plasma, while
        another had a serious allergic reaction. Therefore the risk-benefit
        balance also needs to be considered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Encouragingly, the review identified 48 ongoing studies, 22 of which are
        randomised controlled trials. These should balance out any differences
        in patient characteristics and give more reliable information about
        whether convalescent plasma is a safe and effective treatment for
        COVID-19.
      </p>
      <h1>What do trusted sources say?</h1>
      <p>
        Earlier this month, the UK Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood,
        Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) outlined the proposal to collect donated
        blood from individuals with 28 days of their recovery from COVID-19. The
        optimal donors are expected to be those who have been hospitalised with
        severe infection, as they would have produced the highest antibody
        levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        The proposal highlights the current restriction that people who have
        been transfused since 1980 are not currently able to donate blood due to
        risk of vCJD transmission. This would mean that people who receive
        convalescent plasma could not then donate themselves, potentially
        limiting future donor numbers. They provisionally propose that these
        individuals should be allowed to donate as the risk is low.
