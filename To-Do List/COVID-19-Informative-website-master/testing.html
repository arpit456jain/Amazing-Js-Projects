          Test and trace is an accepted way of trying to limit the number of
          people each person with an infection passes it on to. This method is
          now being used to combat COVID-19. By testing people with symptoms,
          doctors find out whether they have SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes
          COVID-19. If the person does have SARS-CoV-2, contact tracers then
          contact everyone that person has recently been in close contact with.
          These people are told to isolate themselves at home to stop them
          spreading the virus. If they develop symptoms they will also be
          tested.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two type of testing available for COVID-19: viral tests and
          antibody tests.
        </p>

        <p>1. A viral test tells you if you have a current infection.</p>
        <p>
          2. An antibody test might tell you if you had a past infection. An
          antibody test might not show if you have a current infection because
          it can take 1–3 weeks after infection for your body to make
          antibodies. Having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 might
          provide protection from getting infected with the virus again. If it
          does, we do not know how much protection the antibodies might provide
          or how long this protection might last.

        <h2>Different methods of testing:-</h2>

        <p>
          1.Rapid diagnostic test (RDT):
        </p>
        <p>
          RDTs typically use a small, portable, positive/negative lateral flow
          assay that can be executed at point of care. RDTs may process blood
          samples, saliva samples, or nasal swab fluids. RDTs produce colored
          lines to indicate positive or negative results.
        </p>
        <p>2.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA):</p>
        <p>
          ELISA can be qualitative or quantitative and generally require a lab.
          These tests usually use whole blood, plasma, or serum samples. A plate
          is coated with a viral protein, such as a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
          Samples are incubated with the protein, allowing any antibodies to
          bind to it. The antibody-protein complex can then be detected with
          another wash of antibodies that produce a color/fluorescent readout.
        </p>
        <p>3.Neutralization assay:</p>
        <p>
          Neutralization assays assess whether sample antibodies prevent viral
          infection in test cells. These tests sample blood, plasma or serum.
          The test cultures cells that allow viral reproduction (e.g., VeroE6
          cells). By varying antibody concentrations, researchers can visualize
          and quantify how many test antibodies block virus replication.
        </p>
        <h2>Tracing in India:-</h2>
        <p>
          In India, the tracing app Aarogya Setu (“bridge to health”) has been
          downloaded more than 100 million times and was the seventh most
          downloaded app worldwide in April. Using a phone's Bluetooth and
          location data, Aarogya Setu lets users know if they have been near a
          person with Covid-19 by scanning a database of known cases of
          infection. The data is then shared with the government. If you've met
          someone in the last two weeks who has tested positive, the app
          calculates your risk of infection based on how recent it was and
          proximity, and recommends measures.
