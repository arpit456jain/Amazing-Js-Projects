      <h1>
        Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019,COVID-19?
      </h1>
      <p>
        On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official
        name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus
        outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease
        is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’
        stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly,
        this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.
        There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly
        cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease,
        caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen
        in humans.
      </p>
      <h1>What is contact tracing?</h1>
      <p>
        Contact tracing is used by health departments to prevent the spread of
        infectious disease. In general, contact tracing involves identifying
        people who have an infectious disease (cases) and their contacts (people
        who may have been exposed) and working with them to interrupt disease
        transmission. For COVID-19, this includes asking cases to isolate and
        contacts to quarantine at home voluntarily. Contact tracing for COVID-19
        typically involves Interviewing people with COVID-19 to identify
        everyone with whom they had close contact during the time they may have
        been infectious, Notifying contacts of their potential exposure,
        Referring contacts for testing, Monitoring contacts for signs and
        symptoms of COVID-19, and Connecting contacts with services they might
        need during the self-quarantine period.
      </p>
      <h1>What is the difference between SARS and COVID-19?</h1>
      <p>
        Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19 are diseases
        caused by viruses belonging to a large family of coronaviruses.The
        viruses are related to each other genetically,but the diseases they
        cause are quite different.
      </p>
      <h1>What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19?</h1>
      <p>
        Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk
        for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick
        with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. However,
        a few children have developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).
        Currently, information about this syndrome is limited. CDC is working
        with state and local health departments to learn more about MIS-C.
      </p>
      <h1>How can I prepare for an outbreak in my area?</h1>
      <p>
        Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the
        health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19
        in your community: Talk with the people who need to be included in your
        plan, and discuss what to do if a COVID-19 outbreak occurs in your
        community. Plan ways to care for those who might be at greater risk for
        serious complications. Make sure they have access to 2 weeks of
        medications and supplies in case you need to stay home for prolonged
        periods of time. Get to know your neighbors and find out if your
        neighborhood has a website or social media page to stay connected.
        Create a list of local organizations that you and your household can
        contact in the event you need access to information, healthcare
        services, support, and resources. Create an emergency contact list of
        family, friends, neighbors, carpool drivers, health care providers,
        teachers, employers, the local public health department, and other
        community resources.
      </p>
      <h1>Can I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals?</h1>
      <p>
        At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role
        in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited
        information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to
        people is considered to be low. A small number of pets have been
        reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly
        after contact with people with COVID-19. Pets have other types of
        coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline
        coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are
        not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak. However, since animals can
        spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to practice
        healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands
        and maintaining good hygiene. For more information on the many benefits
        of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals
        including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDC’s Healthy Pets,
        Healthy People website.
      </p>
      <h1>Should side walks and roads be disinfected to prevent COVID-19?</h1>
      <p>
        CDC does not recommend disinfection of sidewalks or roads. Spraying
        disinfectant on sidewalks and roads is not an efficient use of
        disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of
        COVID-19 to the public. The risk of spreading the virus that causes
        COVID-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not
        effective on these surfaces.
